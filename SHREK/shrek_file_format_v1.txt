// EB_section_write_permission, allows the original process to write on that section
// EB_section_execute_permission, allows the original function to jump on that section
// EB_section_share_permission, makes the section available to other processes
// EB_section_share_main_permissions, makes the section available to other processs as same as
// the original process in terms of write and execute permissions
//note: EB_key 0 means there is no need for key


//note: every section is readable from original process
//note2: a section can be either writable or executable
//note3: section share type permissions are valid if only  EB type is ".shared"
//note4 section permissions of a ".dynamic" EB are ignored. The original EB's shared permissions are used.


//note: unlike the name suggests(Executable Block), an EB might not include ".text" section and still be valid but not executable

//EB types: ".local", ".shared", ".dynamic"
//.local: The EB is not available to other processes in any terms. The EB is fetched from the corresponding shrek file.
//.shared: The EB is available to other processes as described in section permissions. The EB is fetched from the corresponding shrek file.
//.dynamic: The EB is already available to the process from another process. The EB is not fetched from the demanding process's shrek file.
